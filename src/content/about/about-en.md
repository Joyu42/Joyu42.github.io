# About Me

Hello! I'm Joyu, currently an undergraduate student. Nice to meet you on the internet.

**I enjoy reading books, listening to music, watching movies, tinkering with computers, and writing code.**

I'll share some content I like, along with some daily summaries and random thoughts.

If you have any questions or would like to chat with me, **feel free to send me an email (Joyu42@foxmail.com).**

> ## _**In case I never see you again, good morning, good afternoon, and good night.**_
