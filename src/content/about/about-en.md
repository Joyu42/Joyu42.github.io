# About Me

Hello! I am Joyu, currently an undergraduate student. It is a pleasure to meet you on the internet.

**I enjoy reading books, listening to music, watching movies, tinkering with computers, and writing code.**

I will share some related content, as well as some daily summaries and random thoughts.

If you would like to communicate with me, **feel free to send me an email (gbc@joyu.ink).**

> ## _**In case I don't see you, good morning, good afternoon, and good night.**_
